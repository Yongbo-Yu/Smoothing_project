One of the recent rough volatility models that showed a promising potential in quantitative finance   is the rough Bergomi model, introduced in \cite{bayer2016pricing}. This new model exhibits consistent results with the empirical fact of implied volatility surfaces being essentially time-invariant, and  ability to capture the term structure of skew observed in equity markets. In the absence of analytical European option pricing methods for the model,  the prevalent option is to use Monte Carlo (MC) simulation for efficient pricing. We design a novel alternative hierarchical approach, based on adaptive sparse grids quadrature, specifically  multi-index stochastic collocation (MISC) as in  \cite{haji2016multi}, coupled with Brownian bridge construction and Richardson extrapolation. This hierarchical method demonstrates substantial computational gains with respect to the standard Monte Carlo method, assuming a sufficiently small error tolerance in the price estimates, across different parameter constellations.

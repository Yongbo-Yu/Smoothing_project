Modeling the volatility to be stochastic, rather than deterministic as in the Black-Scholes model, enabled quantitative analysts to  explain certain phenomena observed in option price data, in particular the implied volatility smile. However, this family of models has a  main drawback consisting in failing  to capture the true steepness of the implied volatility smile close to maturity. To overcome this undesired feature, one may add jumps to stock price models, for instance modeling the stock price process as an exponential L\'evy process. Unfortunately, the presence of jumps in stock price processes remains controversial \cite{christensen2014fact,bajgrowicz2015jumps}, and is one of the major criticisms of such models. 



Motivated by the statistical analysis of realized volatility by Gatheral, Jaisson and Rosenbaum \cite{gatheral2014volatility} and the theoretical results on implied volatility by Fukasawa \cite{fukasawa2011asymptotic}, rough stochastic volatility has emerged as a new paradigm in quantitative finance, overcoming the observed limitations of  diffusive stochastic volatility models. In these models, the trajectories of the volatility  has lower H\"older regularity than those of the standard Brownian motion \cite{gatheral2014volatility,bayer2016pricing}. In fact, they are based on fractional Brownian motion (fBm), which  is a centered Gaussian process, whose covariance structure depends on the Hurst parameter $0<H<1/2$ (we refer to  \cite{mandelbrot1968fractional,coutin07introduction,biagini2008stochastic} for more details regarding the fBm processes). In this case, the fBm has negatively correlated increments and rough sample paths.   Gatheral, Jaisson, and Rosenbaum \cite{gatheral2014volatility}  empirically demonstrate the advantages of such models. For instance, they show that the log-volatility in practice has a similar behavior to  fBm with the Hurst exponent $H \approx 0.1$ at any reasonable time scale (see also  \cite{gatheral2014volatility_2}).  These results were confirmed  by Bennedsen, Lunde and Pakkanen \cite{bennedsen2016decoupling}, who studied over a thousand individual US equities and showed that the Hurst parameter $H$ lies in $(0,1/2)$ for each equity. Other  works \cite{gatheral2014volatility,bennedsen2016decoupling,bayer2016pricing} showed further benefits of  such rough volatility models over  standard stochastic volatility ones,   in terms of explaining crucial phenomena  observed in  financial markets.
 
 One of the recent rough volatility models is the rough Bergomi (rBergomi) model, developed by Bayer, Friz and Gatheral \cite{bayer2016pricing}. This model showed   consistent behavior with the stylized fact of implied volatility surfaces being essentially time-invariant. It was also proven that this model 
 is able to capture the term structure of skew observed in equity markets. The construction of the rBergomi model was performed by  moving from  physical to pricing measure and simulating prices under that model to fit  the implied volatility surface well in the case of the S\&P $500$ index with few parameters. The model may be seen as a non-Markovian extension of the Bergomi variance curve model \cite{bergomi2005smile}.
 
Despite the promising features of the rBergomi model, pricing  and hedging under such model still constitutes a challenging, and time consuming task due  to the non-Markovian nature of the fractional driver. In fact, the standard numerical pricing methods, such as: Monte Carlo (MC) estimators, PDE discretization schemes, asymptotic expansions and transform
methods, being efficient in the case of diffusion, are not easily  carried over to the rough setting. Furthermore,  due to the lack of Markovianity or affine structure, conventional analytical pricing methods  do not apply. To the best of our knowledge, the only prevalent method for pricing  options under such models is MC simulation. In particular,  recent advances in simulation methods for the rBergomi model and different variants of pricing methods based on  MC under such model   have been proposed in \cite{bayer2016pricing,bayer2017regularity,mccrickerd2017turbocharging,bennedsen2017hybrid,jacquier2018vix}.  For instance, in \cite{mccrickerd2017turbocharging}, the authors employ a novel composition of variance reduction methods. When pricing under the rBergomi model, they got  substantial computational gains  over the standard MC method. More attempts to have  analytical understanding of option pricing and implied volatility under this model have been achieved  in \cite{jacquier2017pathwise,bayer2017short,forde2017asymptotics}. 


In this paper,  we design a novel hierarchical fast option pricer,  based on a  hierarchical adaptive sparse grids quadrature, specifically  multi-index stochastic collocation (MISC) as in  \cite{haji2016multi}, coupled with Brownian bridge construction and Richardson extrapolation, for options whose underlyings  follow the rBergomi model as in \cite{bayer2016pricing}.  In order to use adaptive sparse grids quadrature for our purposes, we  solve two main issues, that constitute the two stages of our new designed method. In the first stage, we smoothen the integrand by using the conditional expectation as was proposed in \cite{romano1997contingent}, in the context of Markovian stochastic volatility  models.   In a second stage, we apply  MISC as in \cite{haji2016multi}, to solve the integration problem. In this stage, we apply two transformations before using the MISC method, in order to overcome the issue of facing a high dimensional integrand due to the discretization scheme used for simulating the rBergomi dynamics. Given that MISC profits from anisotropy, the first transformation consists of applying a hierarchical  path generation method, based on Brownian
bridge (Bb) construction, with the aim of reducing the effective dimension. The second transformation consists of applying Richardson extrapolation to reduce the bias, which in turn reduces the needed number of time steps in the coarsest level to achieve a certain error tolerance, and therefore,  the maximum number of dimensions needed for the integration problem.

Compared to the works that we mentioned above, mainly \cite{mccrickerd2017turbocharging}, our first contribution is that we design a novel alternative approach based on adaptive sparse grid quadrature. Given that the only prevalent option in this context is to use different variants of the MC method, our work opens a new  research direction in this field to investigate the performance of other methods than MC to solve pricing and calibration problems related to the rBergomi model. Our second contribution is that we reduce the computational cost, through variance reduction,  by using the conditional expectation as in \cite{mccrickerd2017turbocharging} but also through bias reduction through using Richardson extrapolation. Finally, assuming one targets price estimates with a sufficiently small  error tolerance, our proposed method demonstrated substantial computational gains  over the standard MC method. We show  these gains through our numerical experiments for  different parameter constellations. In this paper, we limit ourselves to comparing our novel proposed method against standard MC. A more systematic comparison against the variant of MC proposed in \cite{mccrickerd2017turbocharging}  can be carried out but this is left for a future work. Another eventual direction of research may also investigate the performance of quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) for such problems.


The outline of this paper is as follows: We start in Section \ref{sec:Problem setting} by  introducing  the pricing framework that we consider. We provide some details about the rBergomi model, option pricing under this model and the simulation scheme used to simulate asset prices following the rBergomi dynamics. Then, in Section \ref{sec:Details our approach and error bounds}, we explain the different building blocks that constitute our proposed method, which are basically MISC, Brownian bridge construction, and Richardson extrapolation. Finally, in Section \ref{sec:Numerical tests}, we show the results obtained through different numerical experiments, across different parameter constellations for the rBergomi model.
